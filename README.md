## Tiny AWS Security Automation Projects

In which I try and fail to implement tiny AWS Security Automation Projects
I suspect most of the ideas I can come up with will already have some AWS Config or SecurityHub automation 
that can perform the task faster and more efficiently
but I'll do them all the same, (shouldn't need an excuse to just build stuff, should I?)
